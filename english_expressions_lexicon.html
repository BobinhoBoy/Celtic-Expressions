                history: "This quintessentially English expression dates back to the 1880s. It refers to Robert Cecil, who was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland by his uncle, Prime Minister Lord Salisbury, in what was seen as an act of nepotism. The phrase came to mean that everything would work out easily due to having connections.",

                history: "This expression emerged in the early 20th century, playing on the English obsession with tea.

                history: "This expression dates back to the early 19th century when men wore wigs. Getting agitated might cause one's wig to slip or fall off, so 'keeping your hair on' became synonymous with maintaining composure. The phrase survived long after wigs went out of fashion.",

                history: "This distinctly English farewell emerged in the early 20th century, possibly derived from 'cheery-bye' or influenced by the Italian 'ciao.' It embodies the English preference for maintaining a cheerful, optimistic tone even when parting.",

                meaning: "It's raining very heavily.",
                history: "This colorful expression has several proposed origins, dating back to the 17th century. One theory suggests it comes from Norse mythology where cats represented rain and dogs represented wind. Another links it to the practice of throwing dead animals from rooftops during heavy storms in medieval times.",

                history: "While now famous worldwide thanks to the London Underground, this phrase was first used in 1968 to warn passengers about the gap between the train and platform. It has become an iconic symbol of London and English attention to safety and courtesy.",
                american: "Watch the gap/be careful",

                history: "While originally meaning 'shining brightly,' by the 20th century 'brilliant' had evolved to express enthusiasm and approval in British English. It became particularly popular in the latter half of the 20th century as a general term of praise.",
                american: "Awesome/great/fantastic",
                french: "Brillant/génial/super"

                meaning: "Extremely pleased or delighted.",
                history: "This expression combines 'chuffed' (pleased) with 'to bits' (completely). 'Chuffed' likely comes from 'chuff,' meaning the sound of a steam engine, suggesting someone is 'steaming' with pleasure. The phrase became popular in the mid-20th century.",

                meaning: "Go away (mildly rude).",
                history: "While containing a word with sexual connotations, 'bugger off' has become a relatively mild way of telling someone to leave in British English. It's been in use since the early 20th century and is now considered more cheeky than truly offensive.",
                american: "Get lost/scram",
                french: "Dégage/fiche le camp"

                meaning: "Making fun of someone or not being serious.",
                history: "This vulgar but widely used expression dates back to the mid-20th century. It refers to deflating someone's ego or pride, much like letting air out of something inflated. Despite its crude nature, it's commonly used in casual British conversation.",

                history: "This cockney rhyming slang comes from 'butcher's hook' rhyming with 'look.' It demonstrates the creative wordplay of East London dialect that became part of broader English vocabulary. The phrase has been used since the early 20th century.",
                american: "Taking a look/checking out",
                french: "Jeter un coup d'œil/regarder"

                meaning: "Having no money; broke.",
                history: "Derived from 'skinned' (as in fleeced or cleaned out), 'skint' emerged in the early 20th century. It's a more colloquial and less harsh way of saying you're broke, typical of English understatement and humor about financial difficulties.",
                american: "Broke/flat broke",
                french: "Fauché/sans le sou"

                meaning: "Very silly or stupid.",
                history: "This humorous comparison to an inanimate cleaning tool has been used since the early 20th century. The choice of 'brush' seems arbitrary, which adds to the expression's charm and demonstrates English fondness for absurd comparisons.",

                history: "The British equivalent of Murphy's Law, 'Sod's Law' reflects the English pessimistic humor about life's inevitable disappointments. The term 'sod' adds a mildly profane edge that makes the concept more emphatically British.",

                meaning: "Making fun of someone or teasing them.",
                history: "This expression is a euphemistic version of 'taking the piss,' with 'mickey' possibly derived from 'Mickey Finn' (a drugged drink) or rhyming slang. It's been used since the mid-20th century as a slightly more polite way to describe mockery.",
                american: "Pulling someone's leg/teasing",

                meaning: "Real, genuine, or very (as an intensifier).",
                history: "While 'proper' traditionally means correct or appropriate, in English slang it's used as an intensifier meaning 'really' or 'very.' This usage became popular in the mid-20th century and shows how formal words evolve into casual emphasis.",
                american: "Really/totally/genuine",

                history: "While 'bloody' was once considered quite profane, it's now a mild intensifier in British English. The expression 'bloody hell' has been used since the 19th century and represents the English talent for creating emphatic phrases that sound stronger than they are.",
